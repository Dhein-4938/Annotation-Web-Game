## Overview

**Pathfinder Chronicles** takes the traditional task of data annotation and reinvents it as a fun, interactive, and narrative-driven game. Players annotate 2D height maps by placing points that define optimal paths across rugged terrain. These paths are dynamically visualized in 3D, providing immediate feedback and encouraging refinement through intuitive controls. As you complete sections of the map, your progress unfolds into a larger world filled with secrets, challenges, and story revelations.

## Narrative & Core Objectives

### Narrative

In a world where safe passage through treacherous mountain ranges is critical, you are part of an elite team of cartographers. Your mission could be any of the following:

- **Exploration:** Map uncharted territories to uncover new lands.
- **Rescue Missions:** Chart safe routes to rescue stranded hikers.
- **Treasure Hunts:** Discover hidden paths leading to lost treasures.

This narrative framework turns the technical task of path annotation into an epic adventure where every completed map reveals more of a mysterious, evolving world.

### Core Objectives

- **Annotate Terrain:** Place and adjust points on a 2D height map to define paths that separate parallel mountain ridges.
- **Optimize Paths:** The game calculates and displays the shortest viable path in a 3D terrain view.
- **Refine & Submit:** Tweak your points until the path meets the required criteria for separating obstacles and ensuring continuity between map chunks.
- **Progress the World Map:** Each completed chunk fills in a section of the larger world map, gradually unlocking new areas and narrative elements.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Basic Setup

- **Chunked Terrain:** The terrain is divided into manageable, evenly sized chunks. Each chunk features fixed edge points to maintain continuity with adjacent segments.
- **Interactive Annotation:** Players start with the fixed edge points and add further points on the 2D map to create a path.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Once points are placed, the game calculates the shortest path and renders it on a 3D terrain model.

### Gameplay Loop

1. **Select a Chunk:** Begin with an available or adjacent chunk on the world map.
2. **Place & Adjust Points:** Start with fixed edge points, then add or drag additional points to shape the path.
3. **Visualize the Path:** Watch as the calculated path appears on the 3D model, showing how well it separates the mountain ranges.
4. **Refine the Annotation:** Modify the path by adding, removing, or adjusting points until it meets the game’s criteria.
5. **Submit and Validate:** Complete the chunk. The game checks for smooth transitions with neighboring chunks and updates your progress on the world map.
